# üé® Skills Commands

Build, manage, and distribute Claude Code Skills with professional tooling.

## Overview

The Skills namespace provides commands for creating comprehensive, production-ready Claude Code Skills through an elicitation-driven development process. Four specialized agents work together to ensure every skill follows best practices and meets quality standards.

## Available Commands

### `/skills:build-skill`

**Primary command for creating new Claude Code Skills**

Creates skills through a structured 4-phase process:
1. **Requirements Elicitation** - Understand user needs through targeted questions
2. **Skill Generation** - Build complete skill structure with files and code
3. **Validation & Testing** - Comprehensive quality assurance and testing
4. **Documentation Enhancement** - Professional documentation and examples

**When to use**:
- Creating new skills from scratch
- Converting workflows into reusable skills
- Building team-shared capabilities
- Packaging expertise for distribution

**Example**:
```
/skills:build-skill

"I need a skill for managing database migrations"
"Create a skill that helps with PDF form filling"
"Build a skill for writing API documentation"
```

## Workflow Examples

### Example 1: Creating a Simple Skill

**Goal**: Skill for writing conventional commit messages

```bash
# Start the process
/skills:build-skill

# Elicitation phase
Q: What commit message format? (Conventional Commits)
Q: Any project-specific requirements? (None)
Q: Example commits to reference? (Yes, from CHANGELOG)

# Generation creates:
- commit-helper/SKILL.md (instructions + examples)

# Validation passes all checks

# Documentation adds:
- Best practices section
- Multiple examples
- Troubleshooting tips

# Result: Production-ready commit helper skill
```

### Example 2: Multi-File Skill with Scripts

**Goal**: PDF form filling skill

```bash
# Start the process
/skills:build-skill

# Elicitation phase
Q: What PDF operations? (Fill forms, extract fields)
Q: Which libraries? (pypdf, pdfplumber)
Q: Safety restrictions? (None, can write files)

# Generation creates:
- pdf-form-filler/SKILL.md (core instructions)
- pdf-form-filler/FORMS.md (form-specific details)
- pdf-form-filler/REFERENCE.md (API docs)
- pdf-form-filler/scripts/fill_form.py
- pdf-form-filler/scripts/validate.py

# Validation tests:
- YAML structure ‚úÖ
- Script execution ‚úÖ
- Dependencies documented ‚úÖ

# Documentation adds:
- 10+ examples
- Troubleshooting section
- Integration patterns

# Result: Comprehensive PDF processing skill
```

### Example 3: Tool-Restricted Read-Only Skill

```bash
# Start the process
/skills:build-skill

# Elicitation phase
Q: Analysis scope? (OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities)
Q: Should modify files? (No, read-only)
Q: Output format? (Detailed report)

# Generation creates:
- security-analyzer/SKILL.md
  - allowed-tools: Read, Grep, Glob
