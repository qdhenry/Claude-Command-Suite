## üåü Overview

The WFGY command suite transforms Claude Code into a semantic reasoning powerhouse with genuine long-term memory, mathematical reasoning validation, and proactive hallucination prevention. This implementation brings 26 specialized commands organized into 5 namespaces, each addressing fundamental limitations in current AI systems.

### Why WFGY?

Traditional AI systems suffer from:
- **No genuine memory** - Context resets between sessions
- **Hallucination risks** - No awareness of knowledge boundaries  
- **Logic inconsistency** - No mathematical validation of reasoning
- **Context loss** - Information disappears after token limits

WFGY solves these through:
- **Semantic Trees** - Persistent, exportable memory structures
- **Mathematical Formulas** - Four core modules validating every reasoning step
- **Boundary Detection** - Knows what it knows and what it doesn't
- **Semantic Compression** - Efficient memory that scales infinitely

## üöÄ Quick Start

```bash
# Initialize WFGY system
/wfgy:init

# Apply complete reasoning to a complex problem
/wfgy:formula-all "How can we prevent AI hallucination?"

# Build semantic memory
/semantic:node-build

# View your reasoning tree
/semantic:tree-view

# Check knowledge boundaries
/boundary:detect "quantum consciousness"

# Export your semantic memory
/semantic:tree-export "my_research.txt"
```

## üìä Performance Improvements

Based on WFGY benchmarks:
- **Reasoning Accuracy**: +22.4%
- **Chain Validity**: +42.1%
- **Stability**: 3.6√ó improvement
- **Hallucination**: Significantly reduced

## üßÆ Mathematical Foundations

### Core Formula Modules

#### BBMC (Semantic Residue Minimization)
```
B = I - G + m * c¬≤
```
Minimizes the difference between current reasoning (I) and ground truth (G).

#### BBPF (Multi-Path Progression)
```
x_next = x + Œ£(V_i) + Œ£(W_j * P_j)
```
Explores multiple reasoning paths in parallel for optimal solutions.

#### BBCR (Collapse-Rebirth Correction)
```
if ||B|| ‚â• B_c or f(S) < Œµ:
    collapse() ‚Üí reset() ‚Üí rebirth()
```
Recovers from reasoning failures and logic breakdowns.

#### BBAM (Attention Modulation)
```
√¢_i = a_i * exp(-Œ≥ * std(a))
```
Optimizes attention distribution across reasoning elements.

### Key Metrics

- **ŒîS (Semantic Tension)**: Measures conceptual distance (0=identical, 1=unrelated)
- **Œª_observe (Logic Vector)**: Tracks reasoning direction (‚Üí‚Üê<>√ó)
- **E_resonance**: Measures reasoning stability over time

### Tree Management Best Practices

```bash
# Create specialized trees for different purposes
/semantic:tree-init "Development"
/semantic:tree-init "Research"
/semantic:tree-init "Creative"
/semantic:tree-init "Debug"

# Switch between contexts
/semantic:tree-switch "Research"

# Regular maintenance
/memory:compress --level standard
/memory:prune --old --low-value
/memory:checkpoint "milestone_v1"
```

### Risk Zones Configuration

- **Safe Zone** (ŒîS < 0.4): Full confidence
- **Transitional** (0.4-0.6): Moderate confidence
- **Risk Zone** (0.6-0.85): Caution required
- **Danger Zone** (‚â•0.85): High hallucination risk

## üìà Metrics & Monitoring

### Key Performance Indicators

Monitor these metrics for optimal performance:

1. **Average ŒîS**: Should stay below 0.5 for coherent reasoning
2. **E_resonance**: Below 0.3 indicates stable reasoning
3. **Logic Vector Distribution**: Balanced mix of ‚Üí‚Üê<> patterns
4. **Tree Growth Rate**: 10-20 nodes per session is typical
5. **Compression Ratio**: 2:1 to 3:1 after compression

### Quality Checks

```bash
# Validate reasoning quality
/reasoning:chain-validate

# Check system stability
/reasoning:resonance

# Assess current risk
/boundary:risk-assess

# Review logic patterns
/reasoning:logic-vector
```

## üîê Data Management

### Export Formats

- **TXT** (Recommended): Maximum compatibility, human-readable
- **JSON**: Full data preservation, programmatic access
- **Markdown**: Formatted reports, documentation

### Backup Strategy

```bash
# Regular checkpoints
/memory:checkpoint "daily_backup"

# Export important trees
/semantic:tree-export "project_backup.txt"

# Before risky operations

```

### Sharing Knowledge

Exported trees can be:
- Shared with team members
