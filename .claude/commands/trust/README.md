# Trust Infrastructure Commands

Commands focused on building and maintaining user trust in AI systems through predictability, reliability, and transparency.

## Trust Through Structure

These commands implement the three pillars of AI-era trust from Franck Hoffmann's framework:
- **Predictability**: Does the system behave the way I expect?
- **Clarity**: Do I understand what just happened, and why?
- **Repairability**: Can I recover if something goes wrong?

## Available Commands

### `/trust:predictability-audit`
Analyze command consistency patterns and system behavior predictability.

**Use when:**
- System behavior seems inconsistent
- Building confidence in automation
- Calibrating trust in AI capabilities
- Monitoring system reliability trends

**Example:**
```bash
/trust:predictability-audit last-30-days
```

### `/trust:confidence-dashboard`
Show system reliability metrics and build user confidence in automated actions.

**Use when:**
- Need overview of system trustworthiness
- Deciding automation comfort levels
- Understanding system success patterns
- Calibrating appropriate trust levels

**Example:**
```bash
/trust:confidence-dashboard
```

## Trust Building Philosophy

### Earned, Not Claimed
Trust must be demonstrated through:
- Consistent successful performance
- Transparent error handling and recovery
- Honest assessment of capabilities and limitations
- User control preservation at all levels

### Graduated Autonomy
Users should gain confidence progressively:
1. **Manual Mode**: User approves every action
2. **Supervised Mode**: System acts, user reviews results
3. **Autonomous Mode**: System acts independently with high confidence
4. **Trusted Mode**: System has earned user confidence through proven reliability

### Appropriate Calibration
Help users trust the right amount:
- High confidence (9.0+/10): Safe to trust automatically
- Medium confidence (7.0-8.9): Review but likely reliable
- Low confidence (<7.0): Requires validation and caution

## Key Metrics Tracked

### Reliability Indicators
- Command success rates and consistency
- Prediction accuracy over time
- Error recovery effectiveness
- User satisfaction trends

### Trust Calibration
- Confidence score accuracy (predicted vs actual success)
- User override patterns (appropriate skepticism)
- Automation adoption rates
- Trust building progression

### Behavioral Consistency
- Same inputs producing same outputs
- Response time stability
- Output format compliance
- Decision logic predictability

## Trust Building Strategies

### Transparency First
- Show all decision factors and weights
- Explain confidence level reasoning
- Acknowledge uncertainties and assumptions
- Make limitations explicit

### Success Documentation
- Highlight reliable performance patterns
- Share success stories and metrics
- Build evidence of competence
- Demonstrate continuous improvement

### Error Recovery
- Quick acknowledgment of mistakes
- Clear explanation of what went wrong
- Demonstration of learning and improvement
- Safeguards to prevent repeat issues

## Integration Points

### With Other Systems
- **Explanation Commands**: Provide reasoning for trust assessments
- **Insight Commands**: Transform trust data into actionable guidance
- **Trust Builder Agent**: Document and share success stories
- **Agency Guardian**: Ensure user control preservation

### Trust Signals
Watch for these indicators:
- **Good**: User questions low-confidence recommendations
- **Good**: User accepts high-confidence actions
- **Concerning**: User blindly accepts all recommendations
- **Concerning**: User rejects proven reliable actions

## Usage Patterns

### Initial Trust Building
```bash
/trust:confidence-dashboard
# Review system track record
# Start with supervised automation
# Gradually increase autonomy as confidence builds
```

### Trust Maintenance
```bash
/trust:predictability-audit
# Monitor for behavioral consistency
# Detect trust calibration issues
# Adjust automation levels as needed
```

### Trust Recovery
When trust breaks down:
```bash
/trust:confidence-dashboard --recent-issues
# Understand what went wrong
# See system improvements made
# Plan graduated re-engagement
```
