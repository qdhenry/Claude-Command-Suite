   ```

2. **Checkpoint and Restoration System**
   Manage system state snapshots:
   ```markdown
   ## 📸 Checkpoint Management
   
   ### Current Checkpoints Available
   **Automatic Checkpoints** (Created before risky operations):
   1. **Pre-Refactor Snapshot** (15 minutes ago)
      - Files: 23 changed, 847 lines affected
      - Restore command: `/trust:restore checkpoint-001`
      - Confidence: 9.9/10 - Complete file state captured
   
   2. **Pre-Deployment State** (2 hours ago)
      - Scope: Full application + database schema
      - Restore command: `/trust:restore checkpoint-002`
      - Confidence: 9.2/10 - Database rollback available
   
   3. **Daily Development Snapshot** (This morning)
      - Scope: All code changes from yesterday
      - Restore command: `/trust:restore checkpoint-003`
      - Confidence: 9.8/10 - Clean working state
   
   ### Manual Checkpoint Creation
   Create restoration points on demand:
   ```bash
   /trust:create-checkpoint "Before major authentication changes" 
   # Creates comprehensive snapshot with restoration instructions
   ```
   
   ### Checkpoint Retention Policy
   - **Automatic**: 7 days for daily, 30 days for major changes
   - **Manual**: Kept until explicitly deleted
   - **Critical**: Permanent retention for production deployments
   ```

3. **Damage Assessment and Recovery Planning**
   Evaluate issues and plan recovery:
   ```markdown
   ## 🩺 Damage Assessment Report
   
   ### Issue Analysis
   **Problem Detected**: Code refactoring broke authentication system
   **Scope of Impact**: 
   - 3 files modified incorrectly
   - 12 tests now failing
   - Authentication flow non-functional
   - No data loss detected
   
   ### Recovery Options Analysis
   
   #### Option 1: Complete Rollback (Confidence: 9.8/10)
   - **Action**: Restore pre-refactor checkpoint
   - **Time**: 2 minutes
   - **Risk**: None - returns to known good state
   - **Trade-off**: Lose all refactoring work (4 hours)
   - **Recommendation**: ✅ Safest option
   
   #### Option 2: Selective Repair (Confidence: 7.4/10)
   - **Action**: Fix authentication issues, keep other changes
   - **Time**: 30-60 minutes 
   - **Risk**: May miss subtle issues
   - **Trade-off**: Preserve refactoring work
   - **Recommendation**: ⚠️ If time permits and expertise available
   
   #### Option 3: Forward Fix (Confidence: 6.1/10)
   - **Action**: Debug and fix authentication in place
   - **Time**: 2-4 hours
   - **Risk**: May introduce additional issues
   - **Trade-off**: Learning opportunity but high cost
   - **Recommendation**: ❌ Not recommended unless other options fail
   
   ### Recommended Recovery Plan
   1. **Immediate**: Execute complete rollback (2 minutes)
   2. **Short-term**: Review refactoring approach offline
   3. **Future**: Implement smaller, incremental changes
   4. **Prevention**: Add authentication tests before next refactor
   ```

4. **Recovery Execution and Validation**
   Perform and verify recovery operations:
   ```markdown
   ## ⚡ Recovery Execution Plan
   
   ### Pre-Recovery Safety Checks
   - [ ] ✅ Current state snapshot created
   - [ ] ✅ Recovery method validated  
   - [ ] ✅ Rollback confirmation received
   - [ ] ✅ Team notified of recovery operation
   
   ### Step-by-Step Recovery Process
   
   **Step 1: Initialize Recovery** (30 seconds)
   ```bash
   /trust:restore checkpoint-001 --validate-first
   # Verifies checkpoint integrity before proceeding
   ```
   
   **Step 2: Execute Rollback** (2 minutes)
   - Restore files from checkpoint
   - Reset git state to known commit
   - Clear any temporary artifacts
   - **Progress**: Real-time status updates provided
   
   **Step 3: Validation** (3 minutes)
   ```bash
   # Automated validation suite
   npm test                    # All tests pass: ✅
   npm run lint               # Code quality: ✅
   npm run security-check     # Security scan: ✅  
   curl -f localhost:3000/health  # Service health: ✅
   ```
   
   **Step 4: Confirmation** (1 minute)
   - [ ] ✅ All systems operational
   - [ ] ✅ Authentication working correctly
   - [ ] ✅ No data loss detected
   - [ ] ✅ Team performance confirmed
   
   ### Recovery Success Metrics
   - **Total Time**: 6.5 minutes (within 10-minute target)
   - **Success Rate**: 100% (all validation checks passed)
   - **Data Integrity**: Verified complete
   - **System Status**: Fully operational
   ```

5. **Repair Learning and Prevention**
   Learn from issues to prevent recurrence:
   ```markdown
   ## 📚 Repair Learning Analysis
   
   ### Root Cause Analysis
   **What Went Wrong**: Refactoring modified authentication logic without adequate testing
   **Why It Happened**: 
   - Insufficient test coverage for authentication edge cases
   - Changes made to multiple related systems simultaneously
   - Missing integration test for full authentication flow
   
   ### Prevention Measures Implemented
   1. **Enhanced Testing** (Confidence: 9.1/10)
      - Added authentication integration tests
      - Increased coverage from 67% to 94%
      - Automated testing before any auth changes
   
   2. **Incremental Change Policy** (Confidence: 8.7/10)
      - Maximum 3 files changed per refactoring PR
      - Required manual testing of affected flows
      - Staged rollout for authentication changes
   
   3. **Improved Checkpointing** (Confidence: 9.4/10)
      - Automatic checkpoints before any auth system changes
      - Extended retention for authentication snapshots
      - Added restoration scripts specific to auth rollbacks
   
   ### Success Metrics Post-Recovery
   - **Similar Issues**: 0 occurrences in 30 days
   - **Recovery Time**: Average improved from 45 to 8 minutes
   - **Team Confidence**: +34% in recovery capabilities
   - **Process Adoption**: 100% of team uses checkpointing
   ```

6. **Emergency Recovery Protocols**
   Handle critical system failures:
   ```markdown
   ## 🚨 Emergency Recovery Procedures
   
   ### Immediate Response Protocol
   **When Everything Breaks**:
   1. **STOP** - Halt all automated processes immediately
   2. **ASSESS** - Quick damage assessment (5-minute limit)
   3. **COMMUNICATE** - Alert team and stakeholders
   4. **RESTORE** - Execute fastest known-good restoration
   5. **VALIDATE** - Verify critical functions only
   6. **INVESTIGATE** - Post-recovery analysis
   
   ### Emergency Rollback Commands
   ```bash
   # Nuclear option: Full system restore
   /trust:emergency-restore --to-last-known-good
   
   # Targeted recovery: Specific subsystem
   /trust:emergency-restore --subsystem=auth --confidence-min=9.0
   
   # Safe mode: Minimal functionality restoration
   /trust:emergency-restore --safe-mode
   ```
   
   ### Recovery Time Objectives (RTO)
   - **Critical Systems**: 5 minutes maximum
   - **Core Functionality**: 15 minutes maximum  
   - **Full Feature Set**: 60 minutes maximum
   - **Complete Recovery**: 4 hours maximum
   
   ### Recovery Point Objectives (RPO)

   - **Configuration**: <5 minutes of changes
   - **User Data**: <1 minute of transactions
   - **System State**: <15 minutes of operations
   ```

7. **Trust Building Through Reliability**
   Use repair success to build confidence:
   ```markdown
   ## 🏆 Repair Success Track Record
   
   ### Recovery Statistics (Last 90 Days)
   - **Total Recovery Operations**: 47
   - **Success Rate**: 97.9% (46/47 successful)
   - **Average Recovery Time**: 8.3 minutes
   - **Zero Data Loss Events**: 100%
   - **User Satisfaction**: 9.2/10 with recovery process
   
   ### User Confidence Building
   **Before Repair Framework**: 
   - 67% of users afraid to try automation
   - Average recovery time: 3.2 hours
   - 23% of recoveries resulted in data loss
   
   **After Repair Framework**:
   - 94% of users comfortable with automation
   - Average recovery time: 8.3 minutes  
   - 0% data loss in recovery operations
   
   ### Trust Calibration Success
   Users now appropriately trust automation because:
   - They know they can recover quickly if needed
   - Recovery process is transparent and predictable
   - Track record proves repair capabilities work
   - Confidence grows with each successful recovery
   ```

**Repairability Principles:**
- **Every action must be reversible or clearly marked as irreversible**
- **Recovery should be faster than the original operation**
- **Users should feel safe to experiment knowing they can undo**
- **Repair success builds trust in automation**

This command ensures users can confidently use AI systems knowing they can always recover from mistakes or unexpected outcomes.
