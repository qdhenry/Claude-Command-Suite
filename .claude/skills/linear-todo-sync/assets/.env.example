# Linear API Configuration
#
# To use the Linear Todo Sync skill, you need a Linear API key.
#
# Setup Instructions:
# 1. Go to Linear API Settings: https://linear.app/settings/api
# 2. Click "Create new key" under Personal API Keys
# 3. Give it a descriptive name (e.g., "Claude Code Sync")
# 4. Copy the generated API key
# 5. Replace the placeholder below with your actual API key
# 6. Copy this file to your project root as .env
#
# IMPORTANT SECURITY NOTES:
# - Never commit the .env file to version control
# - Add .env to your .gitignore file
# - Keep your API key confidential
# - Rotate keys periodically (every 90 days recommended)
#
# Your Linear API key (starts with "lin_api_")
